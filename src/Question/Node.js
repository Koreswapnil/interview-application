Built on Chromes V8 JavaScript engine, it allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages and applications. Node.js operates on a single-threaded, event-driven architecture, which facilitates asynchronous and non-blocking I/O operations. This makes it efficient for handling concurrent requests and building scalable network applications.',
