    Q: 'What is JavaSript?',
    A: 'JavaScript is the object-oriented programming language of the web. It can update and change both HTML and CSS. It can calculate, manipulate and validate data.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    Q: 'What are different data types present in javascrips?',
    A: '1) Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null. 2) Non-primitivr types: Array, Object',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    Q: 'What is variable? What is difference between var, let, const keywords?',
    A: 'Variables are used to store data. var creates a function-scoped variable. let and const creates a block-scoped variable. const can be assigned only once and it can not be changed afterward. Variable declared with var keyword is hoisted.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    Q: 'What is hoisting?',
    A: 'Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top. Javascript functions except arrow function are hoisted. Variable with var keyword are hoisted.',
  },

  {
    id: 5,
    Q: 'What is undefined in Javascript?',
    A: 'A variable which is declared but not assigned a value is undefined.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    Q: 'What is implicit type coercion in javascript?',
    A: 'Implicit type coercion in javascript is the automatic conversion of value from one data type to another. It takes place when operands of an expression are of different data types.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    Q: 'What is function in javascript? State different types of functions.',
    A: 'A function is reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Types- Named function, Anonymous Function, Function expression, Arrow Function, IIFE(Immediate Invoked Function Expression), Callback Function, Higher-Order Function.',
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    Q: 'What is difference between arguments and parameters?',
    A: 'Parameters are the placeholders defined in the function delaration. Arguments are the actual values passed to a function when it is invoked or called.',
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    Q: 'What is difference between named and anonymous functions?',
    A: 'Named functions have a name identifier. Anonymous functions do not have a name identifier and can not be refered directly by name. Named functions used for big and complex logic. Anonymous functions used for small logic. We can reuse one named function multiple times. We can use anonymous function in single place.',
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    Q: 'What is function expression?',
    A: 'A function expression is a way to define a function by assigning it to a variable.',
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    Q: 'What is Callback function?',
    A: 'A Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.',
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    Q: 'What is Higher-order function in JS?',
    A: 'A Higher-order function is function that takes one or more functions as arguments(calback function) OR returns a function as result.',
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    Q: 'What is Pure and Impure functions in JS?',
    A: 'A pure function is a function that always produces the same output for the same input. An impure function, can produce different outputs for the same input. Pure function can not modify the state. Impure function can modify the state.  Pure function can not have side effect. Impure function can have side effect.',
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    Q: 'What is function currying?',
    A: 'Its a unique way to call inner functions where you can pass arguments partially or pass multiple arguments in a function but 1 argument at a time. Currying in javascript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument.',
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    Q: 'What is Closure in Javascript?',
    A: 'Closures are an ability of function to remember the variables and functions that are declared in the outer scope.',
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    Q: 'What are the types of errors in JS?',
    A: 'There are two types of error in javascript. 1. Syntax Error: Syntax errors occur due spelling problem in code. This cause the programto not execute at all. 2. Logical Error: Reasoning mistakes occur when the syntax is proper but the logic is incorrect. The application executes without problem in this case. However output findings are inaccurate.',
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    Q: 'What is scope of variable?',
    A: 'It is availability or visibility or lifetime of a variable. Types of scope - Globle scope, Function scope, Block scope',
  },
